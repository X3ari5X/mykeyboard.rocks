<h2 id="getting-keycaps">Getting keycaps from WASD keyboards</h2>

The designs on this site can be printed from WASD keyboards by ordering a
[full keycap set](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keycap-set.html)
($50 USD)
or
a [WASD V2
keyboard](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard.html)
($150 USD).
When ordering, you will need to upload the layout file you want and choose the
colors of the keycaps with the online design tool
(currently there is no way to export/upload keycap colors on the WASD online
designer so the colors aren't included on this site). Note that when choosing
keycap colors any black legends that are printed on black keys will be changed
to white before printing.

<h2 id="keycap-plastic">What sort of plastic do WASD use for their keycaps?</h2>
WASD use UV coated [ABS](http://deskthority.net/wiki/Keycap_construction#ABS)
for their keycaps.


<h2 id="ansi-or-iso">Difference between ANSI and ISO layouts</h2>

ANSI and ISO are two most common classes of layouts for Western keyboards.
ANSI is mainly used by English speaking countries, while the ISO layout is
popular in Europe.
The two images below highlight the keys that are differ in the two layouts.

<h2 id="create-your-own">How to create your own layout</h2>

Most of the designs on this site were made using
[inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) a free and open source vector graphics
editor. See
