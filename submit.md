To submit a layout [message me on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dashboard)
or make an issue/pull request on [github](https://github.com/demicat/mykeyboard.rocks).

The layout should include:

* A name for your layout
* A nice shot of your layout with all the keys visible.
* The layout file (.svg, .ai). (try to remove unnecessary layers)
* Credit any sources you used for your design.
* [optional] A 400x200 pixel thumbnail (I'll make one for you if you leave this out).

Try to keep the total submission size under 2MB.
