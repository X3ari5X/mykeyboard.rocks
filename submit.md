To submit a layout [message me on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/demicat)
or make an issue/pull request on [github](https://github.com/demicat/mykeyboard.rocks).

The layout should include:

* A name
* A nice picture of your layout with all the keys visible.
* A layout file (.svg, .ai). (try to remove unnecessary layers)
* Credit for any sources you used for your design.
* [optional] A 400x200 pixel thumbnail (I'll make one for you if you leave this out).

Try to keep the total submission size under 2MB.
